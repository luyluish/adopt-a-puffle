<h1>Adopt-A-Puffle</h1>
The first HTML/CSS project I made, with the goal of putting in practice the basics I have learnt while studying from different sources on the internet.

<h2>üìëAbout the Project</h2>
<a href="https://luyluish.github.io/adopt-a-puffle/">Adopt-A-Puffle</a> is a survey-type website that simulates the adoption process of a <b>Puffle</b>, a fictional species of domestic pets from the game Club Penguin. Since it's written only in HTML and CSS, it has no functionality, it's just a static page. I had the idea to make my first project about these pets because Club Penguin was a joyful part of my childhood life, so I thought using a good memory as part of my learning experience would make things a lot more fun.

<h6><em>(Club Penguin is a property of Disney, everything here was made for study intentions only)</em></h6>
